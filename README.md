# Logistic-Regression-with-MNIST

Build and train a Multiclass Logistic Regression model using the popular MNIST dataset, this experiment demonstrate that even though
traditional statistic methods might work just fine for computer vision tasks, they are not well fitted. 

That's why deep learning has been so popular for the recent years. For computer vision, new methods like ConvNet, YOLO, Unet...are being 
applied throughout the indsutry, and opensource package like OpenCV, Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch all can deal with computer vision
tasks really well.
